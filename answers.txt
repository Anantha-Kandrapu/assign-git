1) git ignore helps us ignore certain type of files(we can choose them using filters) , to avoid pushing binary files 
 to the remote repository.

2) Git fastforward means git simply moves the source branch pointer to the target branch pointer without creating an extra merge commit.

3) Branching allows collabration , multiple developers can work on their own copy of the code and then merge into the main repo when it works.

4) A project is done only in one repository but this is not a rule. we can work on multiple repositories for a single project
