1)What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
 git ignore helps us ignore certain type of files(we can choose them using filters) , to avoid pushing binary files 
 to the remote repository.

2)What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Git fastforward means git simply moves the source branch pointer to the target branch pointer without creating an extra merge commit.

3)Why should you have different branches?
Branching allows collabration , multiple developers can work on their own copy of the code and then merge into the main repo when it works.

4)In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
 A project is done only in one repository but this is not a rule. we can work on multiple repositories for a single project
